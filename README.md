# finance_calculator
This code allows a user to access two different finance calculators. An investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

If the user selects an investment calculator, the program will ask how much money the user wants to invest. The interest rate they want, whether it is compound interest or simple interest.The number of years they wish to invest for.
The program will output the amount the user will get after the number of years the user input and the interest they requested.
If the user selected a home loan repayment calculator by inputting the word bond, the program will ask the user to enter the present value of their house. The interest rate on the bond and the number of months they will take to repay the bond.
The program will calculate the amount the user will have to repay each month till the bond is paid off.

This program is designed for users who want a simple calculator with a built-in formula to calculate interest earned to bond repayments

The goal of the project is to create a simple calculator for users to use.
